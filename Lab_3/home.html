            IAD Problem Statement
            Consider the Pine Valley Furniture Company database designed and implemented using structured query language
            during previous semester. Try to recall major relations in the database (CUSTOMER_T, ORDER_T, ORDER_LINE_T,
            and PRODUCT_T).
            There is a need to implement a web based solution for above mentioned database. The web based solution must
            incorporate following functionalities:
            <br>i) New Customer Registration
            <br>ii) Searching of Products
            <br>iii) Products Selection and Order Placement
            <br>iv) Product Catalog Update
            <br>v) Payment Provision
            As a first step design above mentioned (i) to (v) user interfaces using paper and pencil.
            Next write appropriate html for creating (i) to (v) user interface prototypes.
            Create links for navigation among above pages.
            Design a menu using list and styles.
            Add help pages for user guidance.
            Either use table for layout or may opt for flow based layout.
            Test user interface prototypes in browser.
            Experiment with style sheets.
